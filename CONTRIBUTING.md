## Local Development

### Code Organization

As a Redwood user, you're already familiar with the codebase created by `yarn create redwood-app`. In this document, we'll refer to that codebase as a 'Redwood App'. As a contributor, you'll have to gain familiarity with another codebase: the Redwood Framework.

The Redwood Framework lives in the monorepo `redwoodjs/redwood` (which is where you're probably reading this). It contains all the packages that make Redwood Apps work the way they do. In a typical Redwood App, you can find the Redwood Framework in `./node_modules/@redwoodjs`.

Throughout this document, we'll assume your local copy of the Redwood Framework is in a directory called `redwood` and your Redwood App is in a directory called `redwood-app`.

### First Steps

Use `git clone` to make a local copy of the Redwood Framework. As mentioned above, we'll assume your local copy is in a directory called `redwood`. This is where you'll be making most of your changes.

If you already have a local copy, make sure you've got the `main` branch's latest changes with `git pull`.

Then run `yarn install` in the root directory to install all the dependencies:

```terminal
cd redwood
yarn install
```

You can also `git clone` one of the Redwood example apps, or use one you already have. As mentioned above, we'll assume your Redwood App is in a directory called `redwood-app`.

### Watching Changes

As you make changes to your local copy of the Redwood Framework, you'll want to see the effects "live" in your Redwood App.

Since we're always looking for ways to make contributing to Redwood easier, there's a few workflows we've come up with, but the one you'll want to use is `yarn rwt link`. You can fall back on any of the others if that one doesn't work, but once you've tried `yarn rwt link`, you won't want to.

> **I've used `yarn rw` before, but what's `yarn rwt`?**
>
> All workflows use `redwood-tools` (`rwt`), Redwood's companion CLI development tool.

#### yarn rwt link

Now that everything's [up-to-date and installed](#first-steps), go to your `redwood-app` and run `yarn rwt link`:

```bash
cd redwood-app
yarn rwt link ../path/to/redwood
```

> You can avoid having to provide the path to `redwood` by defining an `RW_PATH` environment variable on your system. See [Specifying a `RW_PATH`](#specifying-a-rw_path).

`rwt link` will first add the redwood workspace to your Redwood App. Then you'll see a ton of output &mdash; `rwt link` is building the Redwood Framework, watching it for changes, and copying all that over into the new redwood workspace in your Redwood App.

Your Redwood App isn't using the packages in `node_modules/@redwoodjs` anymore. It's now using the packages in the new workspace with your local changes. You can even install packages or upgrade dependencies &mdash; it's really that simple.

`rwt link` won't return you to the command line. Once it sets everything up you should see:
```terminal
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │                                                             │
   │   🚀 Go Forth and Contribute!                               │
   │                                                             │
   │   🔗  Your project is linked!                               │
   │                                                             │
   │   Contributing doc: https://redwoodjs.com/docs/contributing │
   │                                                             │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

you can open a new tab in your terminal, cd to `redwood-app` and launch your Redwood App from there. As you make changes in `redwood`, you will see those changes immediately in the behavior of your Redwood App.

When you're done, go back to your `rwt link` tab and ctrl-c to quit. `rwt link` will ask you to run the `yarn rwt unlink` command. This will restore your Redwood App to its original state, reverting it to the version of Redwood that it originally had installed.

Next time you want to contribute, just run `yarn rwt link` again!


*Flags for rwt link command:*
| Flag | Description                              |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------- |
| `RW_PATH`              | Path to the framework repo. Required if RW_PATH environment var not set                         |
| `--clean, -c`       | Clean the framework repo before linking? Set this to false to speed things up if you're sure your build folders are clean [default: true]                 |
| `--watch, -w`           | Set this to false if you just want to link once and not watch for file changes [default: true]      |

> Having trouble with `rwt link`? Check the [rwt link FAQ](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/issues/2215). If that doesn't help, please try one of the legacy contributing flows below.

#### Copy and Watch

`yarn rwt link` not working for you? That's ok &mdash; we have a few legacy contributing workflows that you can fall back on.

After you've gotten everything [up-to-date and installed](#first-steps), make sure your Redwood App is on the latest canary release:

```terminal
cd redwood-app
yarn rw upgrade -t canary
yarn install
```

Now you'll want to build-and-watch the files in the Redwood Framework for changes:

```terminal
cd redwood
yarn build:watch
```

this will echo:

```terminal
@redwoodjs/api: $ nodemon --watch src -e ts,js --ignore dist --exec 'yarn build'
@redwoodjs/core: $ nodemon --ignore dist --exec 'yarn build'
create-redwood-app: $ nodemon --ignore dist --exec 'yarn build'
@redwoodjs/eslint-plugin-redwood: $ nodemon --ignore dist --exec 'yarn build'
```

`build:watch` won't return you to the command line. Once it stops outputting to the terminal, you can open a new tab in your terminal, cd to `redwood-app` and run `rwt copy:watch` to get the changes in your local copy of the Redwood Framework:

```terminal
cd redwood-app
yarn rwt copy:watch ../path/to/redwood
```

You can also use the alias `cpw`:

```terminal
cd redwood-app
yarn rwt cpw ../path/to/redwood
```

> You can avoid having to provide the path to `redwood` by defining an `RW_PATH` environment variable on your system. See [Specifying a `RW_PATH`](#specifying-a-rw_path).

this will echo:

```terminal
Redwood Framework Path:  /something/something/redwoodjs/redwood
Trigger event:  add
building file list ... done
```

`rwt copy:watch` won't return you to the command line. Once it stops outputting to the terminal, you can open a new tab in your terminal, cd to `redwood-app` and launch your Redwood App. As you make changes in `redwood`, you will see those changes immediately in the behavior of your Redwood App.

Now any changes made in the framework will be copied into your app!

When you're done, go back to your `build:watch` and `rwt copy:watch` tabs and ctrl-c to quit.

Then, you can restore your Redwood App to its original state by deleting `./node_modules`, `web/node_modules`, and `api/node_modules`, then running `yarn install`.

#### cp

If you are on Windows and not using WSL, you will have to use `rwt cp` (this is tracked in [issue #701](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/issues/701)). This method, unfortunately, will not let you see your changes live.

Also, you most likely first have to [install `rsync`](https://tlundberg.com/blog/2020-06-15/installing-rsync-on-windows/).

Each time you make a change to your local Redwood Framework, you'll have to build it:

```terminal
cd redwood
yarn build
```

Then, you'll go to your Redwood App and copy the changes:

```terminal
cd redwood-app
yarn rwt cp ../path/to/redwood
```

Then you can test the effects of your changes. Unfortunately, each time you make a change to your local Redwood Framework, you'll have to manually run `build` and `rwt cp` again.

When you're done, you can restore your Redwood App to its original state by deleting `./node_modules`, `web/node_modules`, and `api/node_modules`, then running `yarn install`.

#### Specifying a RW_PATH

You can avoid having to provide the path to `redwood` by defining an `RW_PATH` environment variable on your system.

##### On **Linux**

Add the following line to your `~/.bashrc`:

```terminal
export RW_PATH=”$HOME/path/to/redwood/framework”
```

Where `/path/to/redwood/framework` is replaced by the path to your local copy of the Redwood Framework.

Then, in your Redwood App or example app, you can just run:

```terminal
yarn rwt link
```

or

```terminal
yarn rwt copy:watch
```

##### On **MacOS**

Add the following line to your `~/.bash_profile`:

```terminal
export RW_PATH=”$HOME/path/to/redwood/framework”
```

Where `/path/to/redwood/framework` is replaced by the path to your local copy of the Redwood Framework.

Then, in your Redwood App or example app, you can just run:

```terminal
yarn rwt link
```

or

```terminal
yarn rwt copy:watch
```

##### On **Windows**

### Local Package Registry Emulation

Sometimes you'll want to test the full package-development workflow: building, publishing, and installing all the packages in your local copy of the Redwood Framework in your Redwood App. We accommodate this using a local NPM registry called [**Verdaccio**](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio).

You might also have to use this workflow if you've installed or upgraded one of Redwood's dependencies.

#### Running a Local NPM Registry

First, install `Verdaccio`:

```terminal
yarn global add verdaccio
```

Then, in your local copy of the Redwood Framework, run:

```terminal
./tasks/run-local-npm
```

This starts `Verdaccio` (on http://localhost:4873) with our configuration file.

#### Publishing a Package

To build, unpublish, and publish all the Redwood packages to your local NPM registry with a "dev" tag, run:

```terminal
./tasks/publish-local
```

> This script is equivalent to running:
>
> ```terminal
> npm unpublish --tag dev --registry http://localhost:4873/ --force
> npm publish --tag dev --registry http://localhost:4873/ --force
> ```

Note that you can build a particular package by specifying the path to the package: `./tasks/publish-local ./packages/api`. For example, if you've made changes to the `@redwoodjs/dev-server` package, you would run:

```terminal
./tasks/publish-local ./packages/dev-server
```

#### Installing Published Packages in Your Redwood App

The last step is to install the package into your Redwood App.

```terminal
yarn rwt install @redwoodjs/dev-server
```

> This is equivalent to running:
>
> ```terminal
> rm -rf <APP_PATH>/node_modules/@redwoodjs/dev-server
> yarn upgrade @redwoodjs/dev-server@dev --no-lockfile --registry http://localhost:4873/
> ```

## Running Your Redwood App's Local Server(s)

When developing Redwood Apps, you’re probably used to running both the API and Web servers with `yarn rw dev` and seeing your changes included immediately.

But for local package development, your changes won’t be included automatically&mdash;you'll need to manually stop/start the respective server to include them.

In this case you might find it more convenient to run the servers for each of the yarn workspaces independently:

```terminal
yarn rw dev api
yarn rw dev web
```

## Integration tests

We're using Cypress to test the steps that we recommend in the tutorial. Run the command by doing the following:

```terminal
./tasks/run-e2e
```

This creates a new project in a temporary directory using `yarn create redwood-app ...` Once installed, it then upgrades the project to the most recent `canary` release, which means it will use the current code in the `main` branch. Once the upgrade is complete (and successful), it will start Cypress for the E2E tests.


```terminal
./tasks/run-e2e /path/to/app
```

Use this `path/to/app` option to run the same Cypress E2E tests against a local project. In this case, the command will _not_ upgrade the project to the `canary` release — it will use the project's installed packages. Chose this option if you have modified code (and packages) you want to test locally.


> Windows Not Supported: The command for this is written in bash and will not work on Windows.

## Releases

To publish a new version of Redwood to NPM run the following commands:

> NOTE: `<version>` should be formatted `v0.24.0` (for example)

```bash
git clean -dfx
yarn install
./tasks/update-package-versions <version>
git commit -am "<version>"
git tag <version>
git push && git push --tags
yarn build
yarn lerna publish from-package
```

This...
  1) changes the version of **all the packages** (even those that haven't changed),
  2) changes the version of the packages within the CRWA Template
  3) Commits, Tags, and Pushes to GH
  4) and finally publishes all packages to NPM.

### Troubleshooting

If something went wrong you can use `yarn lerna publish from-package` to publish the packages that aren't already in the registry.

## CLI Reference: `redwood-tools`


> This section covers the `redwood-tools` command options.
>
> For `redwood` options, see the [CLI Reference on redwoodjs.com](https://redwoodjs.com/reference/command-line-interface).

### redwood-tools (rwt)

Redwood's companion CLI development tool. You'll be using this if you're contributing to Redwood.

```
yarn rwt <command>
```

|Command | Description|
|:-|:-|
|`copy` | Copy the Redwood Framework path to this project.|
|`copy:watch` | Watch the Redwood Framework path for changes and copy them over to this project.|
|`fix-bins` | Fix Redwood symlinks and permissions.|
|`install` | Install a package from your local NPM registry.|
|`link` | Link the Redwood Framework path to this project and watch it for changes.|

### copy (cp)

Copy the Redwood Framework path to this project.

```terminal
yarn rwt cp [RW_PATH]
```

You can avoid having to provide `RW_PATH` by defining an environment variable on your system. See [Specifying a `RW_PATH`](#specifying-a-rw_path).

### copy:watch (cpw)

Watch the Redwood Framework path for changes and copy them over to this project.

```terminal
yarn rwt cpw [RW_PATH]
```

You can avoid having to provide `RW_PATH` by defining an environment variable on your system. See [Specifying a `RW_PATH`](#specifying-a-rw_path).

### fix-bins (fix)

Fix Redwood symlinks and permissions.

```terminal
yarn rwt fix
```

The Redwood CLI has the following binaries:

- `redwood`
- `rw`
- `redwood-tools`
- `rwt`
- `dev-server`

When you're contributing, the permissions of these binaries can sometimes get mixed up. This makes them executable again.

### install (i)

Install a package from your local NPM registry.

```terminal
yarn rwt i <packageName>
```

You'll use this command if you're testing the full package-development workflow. See [Local Package Registry Emulation](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#local-package-registry-emulation).

### link

Link the Redwood Framework path to this project and watch it for changes.

```terminal
yarn rwt link [RW_PATH]
```

You can avoid having to provide `RW_PATH` by defining an environment variable on your system. See
[Specifying a `RW_PATH`](#specifying-a-rw_path).
