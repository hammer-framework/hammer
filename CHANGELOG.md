# CHANGELOG

## Unreleased

- fix(scenario): Make sure to clean up scenarios even if tests fail (#10112)
  Fixes an issue where a unit test failure would cause the scenario cleanup to be skipped. Thanks @peraltafederico  and @cjreimer for highlighting this!
  
- fix(serve): Allow periods in most paths (#10114)

  Partial fix for route paths with periods in them.

  It's only "partial" because it doesn't fix it for `yarn rw dev`, as that's a
  Vite bug
  ([vitejs/vite#2415 (comment)](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/2415#issuecomment-1720814355)).
  And there's also an edge case for yarn rw serve where this doesn't fully
  handle client-side routes that start with /assets/ and that also have a
  last-segment that accepts a period, like /assets/client-route-image.jpg
  
  Fixes #9969

- fix(deps): update prisma monorepo to v5.10.2 (#10088)

  This release updates Prisma to v5.10.2. Here are quick links to all the release notes since the last version (v5.9.1):

  - https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/5.10.0
  - https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/5.10.1
  - https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/5.10.2

- fix(deps): update opentelemetry-js monorepo (#10065)

  Updates our opentelemetry packages. This is a breaking change for users of
  our experimental opentelemetry support. This is what their changelog says is
  breaking:

  * fix(exporter-metrics-otlp-grpc): programmatic headers take precedence over
    environment variables #2370 @Vunovati
  * fix(exporter-metrics-otlp-http): programmatic headers take precedence over
    environment variables #2370 @Vunovati
  * fix(exporter-metrics-otlp-proto): programmatic headers take precedence over
    environment variables #2370 @Vunovati
  * fix(otlp-exporter-base)!: decrease default concurrency limit to 30 #4211
    @pichlermarc
    * fixes a memory leak on prolonged collector unavailability
    * this change is marked as breaking as it changes defaults
  * fix(instrumentation)!: pin import-in-the-middle@1.7.1 #4441
    * Fixes a bug where, in some circumstances, ESM instrumentation packages
      would try to instrument CJS exports on ESM, causing the end-user
      application to crash.
    * This breaking change only affects users that are using the experimental
      @opentelemetry/instrumentation/hook.mjs loader hook AND Node.js 18.19 or
      later:
      * This reverts back to an older version of import-in-the-middle due to
        DataDog/import-in-the-middle#57
      * This version does not support Node.js 18.19 or later

- Add support for loading more env var files (#9961, #10093, and #10094)

  Fixes #9877. This PR adds CLI functionality to load more `.env` files via `NODE_ENV` and an `--add-env-files` flag.
  Env vars loaded via either of these methods override the values in `.env`:

  ```
  # Loads '.env.production', which overrides values in '.env'
  NODE_ENV=production yarn rw exec myScript

  # Load '.env.stripe' and '.env.nakama', which overrides values
  yarn rw exec myScript --add-env-files stripe --add-env-files nakama
  # Or you can specify the flag once:
  yarn rw exec myScript --add-env-files stripe nakama
  ```

  Note that this feature is mainly for local scripting. Most deploy providers don't let you upload `.env` files (unless you're using baremetal) and usually have their own way of determining environments.
