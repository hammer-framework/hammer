# Environment Variables

You can provide environment variables to each side of your Redwood project in different ways, depending on your target.

## API
On the API side with NodeJS as your target, you can add access the environment variables defined in your `.env` and `.env.defaults` file.

## WEB
On the Web side with webpack as your target, you can do one of three things:

1. Prefix your env vars with `REDWOOD_ENV_` â€”they will be available via `process.env.REDWOOD_ENV_MY_VAR_NAME`

2. Whitelist them in your `redwood.toml`. For example:

```toml
[web]
  includeEnvironmentVariables = ['API_KEY']
```

3. Define them in your `.env` file
