# Wrapping Up

You made it! If you really went through the whole tutorial: congratulations! If you just skipped ahead to this page to try and get a free congratulations: tsk, tsk!

That was potentially a lot of new concepts to absorb all at once so don't feel bad if all of it didn't fully sink in. React, GraphQL, Prisma, serverless functions...so many things! Even those of us working on the framework are heading over to Google multiple times per day to figure out how to get these things to work together.

As an anonymous Twitter user once mused: "If you enjoy switching between feeling like the smartest person on earth and the dumbest person in history all in the same day, programming may be the career for you!"

### What's Next?

If you're ready for even more Redwood, head to the [Tutorial Part 2](../tutorial2/welcome-to-redwood-part-ii-redwoods-revenge)! We'll look at Storybook and Jest and build a new feature for the blog: comments. Storybook introduces a new way to build components. We'll also add tests and run them with Jest to make sure things keep working as we expect. We cover authorization as well by giving a special role to comment moderators.

Want to add some more features to your app? Check out some of our Cookbook recipes like [calling to a third party API](https://redwoodjs.com/cookbook/using-a-third-party-api) and [deploying an app without an API at all](https://redwoodjs.com/cookbook/disable-api-database). Have you grown out of SQLite and want to [install Postgres locally](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/local-postgres-setup)? We've also got lots of [guides](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/introduction) for more info on Redwood's internals.

### Roadmap

Check out our [Roadmap](https://redwoodjs.com/roadmap) to see where we're headed and how we're going to get there.
If you're interested in helping with anything you see, just let us know over on the [RedwoodJS Forum](https://community.redwoodjs.com/) and we'll be happy to get you set up. The general availability of version 1.0 is expected in the first half of 2022!
