# TypeScript Strict Mode

Looks like you're ready to level up your TypeScript game!
Redwood supports [strict mode](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/basic-types.html#strictness), but doesn't enable it by default.
While strict mode gives you a lot more safety, it makes your code a bit more verbose and requires you to make small manual changes if you use the generators.

## Enabling strict mode

Enable strict mode by setting `strict` to true in `web/tsconfig.json` and `api/tsconfig.json`, and if you're using scripts in `scripts/tsconfig.json`:

```json title="web/tsconfig.json, api/tsconfig.json, scripts/tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noEmit": true,
    "allowJs": true,
    // highlight-next-line
    "strict": true,
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

Redwood's type generator behaves a bit differently in strict mode, so now that you've opted in, make sure to generate types:

```
yarn rw g types
```

## Manual tweaks to generated code

Now that you're in strict mode, there are some changes you need to make to get rid of those pesky red underlines!

### Service functions & tests

By default, Redwood's generators assume that Service functions don't require any parameters. For example, [in the tutorial](../tutorial/chapter2/side-quest.md), the `posts` Service function generated by the scaffold command doesn't specify any parameters:

```ts title="src/services/posts/posts.test.ts"
// highlight-next-line
export const posts: QueryResolvers['posts'] = () => {
  return db.post.findMany()
}
```

While this is true, in the strictest sense, all GraphQL resolvers (and most of your Service functions _do_ end up becoming GraphQL resolvers) take some sort of input, so you'll need to modify the calls to your Service functions that have been typed with `QueryResolvers` or `MutationResolvers`:

```ts title="src/services/posts/posts.test.ts"
describe('posts', () => {
  scenario('returns all posts', async (scenario: StandardScenario) => {
    const result = await posts() // ðŸ›‘ error
    const result = await posts({}) // âœ…

    expect(result.length).toEqual(Object.keys(scenario.post).length)
  })
})
```

:::info Why this happens in strict mode

In strict mode, Redwood generates different types for `QueryResolvers` and `MutationResolvers`, where the first argumentâ€”`args`â€”is no longer optional.

We realize that this isn't a perfect solution, but the tension comes from the fact that we can't define different types for when a Service function is called from inside GraphQL (as a resolver) versus when it's called from anywhere else.

:::

### `null` and `undefined` in Services

One of the challenges in the GraphQL-Prisma world is the difference in the way they treats optionals:

- for GraphQL, optional fields can be `null`
- but For Prisma, `null` is a value, and `undefined` means "do nothing"

This is covered in detail in [Prisma's docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/null-and-undefined), which we strongly recommend reading.
But the gist of it is that, for Prisma's create and update operations, you have to make sure `null`s are converted to `undefined` from your GraphQL mutation inputs - unless the field is nullable in your Prisma schema.

One way to do this is to use the `removeNulls` utility function from `@redwoodjs/api`

```ts title=api/src/services/users.ts
// highlight-next-line
import { removeNulls } from "@redwoodjs/api"

export const updateUser: MutationResolvers["updateUser"] = ({ id, input }) => {
  return db.user.update({
    // highlight-next-line
    data: removeNulls(input),
    where: { id },
  })
}
```

### Relation resolvers in services
Let's say you have a `Post` model, and `Post.author` is a relation to the `Author` model, and is a required field.

```graphql Post.sdl.ts
export const schema = gql`
  type Post {
    id: Int!
    title: String!
    // highlight-next-line
    author: Author! # ðŸ‘ˆ this is a relation, the ! makes it a required field
    authorId: Int!
    # ...
  }

```

When you generate your services or SDLs, you'll notice that the resolvers for `Author` are generated at the bottom of Post.service.ts

Because `Post.author` cannot be null - and findUnique always returns a nullable value, under strict-mode you'll have to tweak these resolvers

```ts Post.service.ts
// Option 1: Override the type
// The typecasting here is OK - remember the "gqlArgs.root" is the post
// that was already found in your service function, so findUnique would always find it!
export const Post: Partial<PostResolvers> = {
  author: (_obj, gqlArgs) =>
    db.post.findUnique({ where: { id: gqlArgs?.root?.id } }).author() as Author,  // ðŸ‘ˆ
}



// Option 2: With null checks âœ…
export const Post: Partial<PostResolvers> = {
  author: async (_obj, gqlArgs) => {
    // Find unique can return a null
    const maybeAuthor = await db.post
      .findUnique({ where: { id: gqlArgs?.root?.id } })
      .author()

// highlight-start
    if (!maybeAuthor) {
      throw new Error('Could not resolve author')
    }
// highlight-end

    return maybeAuthor
  },
}
```


:::tip An optimisation tip
If the relation is _truly_ required, it might make more sense to include `author` in your other services' Prisma query, where it seems appropriate, and modify the `Post.author` resolver:

```ts
export const post: QueryResolvers['post'] = ({ id }) => {
  return db.post.findUnique({
    // highlight-start
    include: {
      author: true,
    },
    // highlight-end
    where: { id },
  })
}

export const Post: Partial<PostResolvers> = {
  author: async (_obj, gqlArgs) => {
   // highlight-start
    if (gqlArgs?.root.author) {
      return gqlArgs.root.author
    }
  // highlight-end


  const maybeAuthor = await db.post.findUnique(// ...
```

This will also help Prisma make a more optimised query to the database, since every time a Post is requested, the Author is too! The tradeoff here is that any query to post (even if the author isn't in the GraphQL query) will mean an unnecessary database query to include the author.

### Roles checks for CurrentUser in `src/lib/auth`

When you setup auth, Redwood includes some template code for handling roles with the `hasRole` function.
While Redwood does runtime checks to make sure it doesn't access roles if it doesn't exist, TypeScript in strict mode will highlight errors, depending on whether you are returning `roles`, and whether those roles are `string` or `string[]`

```typescript
export const hasRole = (roles: AllowedRoles): boolean => {
  if (!isAuthenticated()) {
    return false
  }

  // highlight-next-line
  const currentUserRoles = context.currentUser?.roles
  // Error: Property 'roles' does not exist on type '{ id: number; }'.ts(2339)
```

You'll have to adjust the generated code depending on your User model.

<details>
<summary>Example code diffs</summary>

#### A. If your project does not use roles

If your `getCurrentUser` doesn't return `roles`, and you don't use this functionality, you can safely remove the `hasRole` function.

#### B. Roles on current user is a string

Alternatively, if  you define the roles as a string, you can remove the code that does checks against Arrays

```diff title="api/src/lib/auth.ts"
export const hasRole = (roles: AllowedRoles): boolean => {
  if (!isAuthenticated()) {
    return false
  }

  const currentUserRoles = context.currentUser?.roles

  if (typeof roles === 'string') {
-    if (typeof currentUserRoles === 'string') {
      return currentUserRoles === roles
-    }
  }

  if (Array.isArray(roles)) {
-    if (Array.isArray(currentUserRoles)) {
-      return currentUserRoles?.some((allowedRole) =>
-        roles.includes(allowedRole)
-      )
-    } else if (typeof currentUserRoles === 'string') {
      // roles to check is an array, currentUser.roles is a string
      return roles.some((allowedRole) => currentUserRoles === allowedRole)
-    }
  }

  // roles not found
  return false
}
```

#### C. Roles on current user is an Array of strings

If in your User model, roles are an array of strings, and can never be just a string, you can safely remove most of the code

```diff title="api/src/lib/auth.ts"
export const hasRole = (roles: AllowedRoles): boolean => {
  if (!isAuthenticated()) {
    return false
  }

 const currentUserRoles = context.currentUser?.roles

  if (typeof roles === 'string') {
-    if (typeof currentUserRoles === 'string') {
-      return currentUserRoles === roles
-    } else if (Array.isArray(currentUserRoles)) {
      // roles to check is a string, currentUser.roles is an array
      return currentUserRoles?.some((allowedRole) => roles === allowedRole)
-    }
  }

  if (Array.isArray(roles)) {
-    if (Array.isArray(currentUserRoles)) {
      return currentUserRoles?.some((allowedRole) =>
        roles.includes(allowedRole)
      )
-    } else if (typeof currentUserRoles === 'string') {
-      return roles.some(
-        (allowedRole) => currentUserRoles === allowedRole
-      )
    }
  }

  // roles not found
  return false
}
```
</details>

### `getCurrentUser` in `api/src/lib/auth.ts`

Depending on your auth providerâ€”i.e., anything but dbAuthâ€”because it could change based on your account settings (if you include roles or other metadata), we can't know the shape of your decoded token at setup time.
So you'll have to make sure that the `getCurrentUser` function is typed.

To help you get started, the comments above the `getCurrentUser` function describe its parameters' types. We recommend typing `decoded` without using imported types from Redwood, as this may be a little too generic!

```ts title='api/src/lib/auth.ts'
import type { AuthContextPayload } from '@redwoodjs/api'

// Example 1: typing directly
export const getCurrentUser: CurrentUserFunc = async (
  decoded: { id: string, name: string },
  { token, type }: { token: string, type: string },
) => {
  // ...
}

// Example 2: Using AuthContextPayload
export const getCurrentUser: CurrentUserFunc = async (
  decoded: { id: string, name: string },
  { token, type }: AuthContextPayload[1],
  { event, context }: AuthContextPayload[2]
) => {
  // ...
}
```
