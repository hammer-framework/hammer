# Introduction

Welcome to Redwood!
Redwood is the full-stack web framework designed to help you grow from side project to startup.
To get the most out of Redwood, do two things:

- Read the [Tutorial](tutorial/foreword.md)
- Join the [community](https://community.redwoodjs.com/)

The Tutorial is a must.
It's readable, feature-ful, and fun.
You'll go all the way from `git clone` to Netlify deploy, and by the end, you should feel comfortable enough the framework to start that side project!

After you've read the Tutorial and started your side project, come say hi and tell us all about it by joining the community!
Redwood wouldn't be where it is without the people who use it, and we love getting to know our users!

> If you're in a hurry, would rather learn as you go, or need a quick reference, check out the [Quick Start](quick-start.md).
> But try to make time to do the [Tutorial](tutorial/foreword.md) at least once.

## How these Docs are Organized

As you can probably tell from the sidebar, Redwood's docs are organized into three categories:

- [Tutorial](tutorial/foreword.md)
- [Reference](index)
- [How To](how-to/index)

The order isn't arbitrary.
This is more or less the learning journey we expect you to take.

While we expect you to read the Tutorial from top to bottom (maybe even more than once?), we of course don't expect you to read the Reference and How To sections that way.
The content in those sections is there on an as-needed basis.
You need to know about the Router? Check out the [Router](router.md) reference.
You need to upload files? Check out the [File Uploads](how-to/file-uploads.md) how to.

That said, there are some references you should really consider reading at some point in Redwood learning journey.
Especially if you want to become an advanced user.
For example, [Services](services.md) are fundamental to Redwood.
It's worth getting to know them inside and out.
And if you're not writing [tests](testing.md) and [stories](storybook.md), you're not using Redwood to its full potential.

And if you're on Windows, the [Windows Development Setup](how-to/windows-development-setup.md) is most definitely required reading.

> We realize the content doesn't always match the organization
> For example, half the [Testing](testing.md) reference reads like a tutorial, and parts of the [Logger](logger.md) reference read like a how to.
>
> Till now, we've focused on coverage, making sure we had content on every feature of the framework somewhere.
> Now that we've released v1, we'll shift our focus to organization, and pay more attention to how we can curate the experience for you as a reader.
