# Prerender

Prerendering is great for providing a faster experience for your end users. Your pages will be rendered at build-time, saving your user's browser from having to do that job.

We thought a lot about what the developer experience should be for route-based prerendering. The result is one of the smallest APIs imaginable!

> As Danny said in his [Prerender demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iorKyMlASZc&t=2844s) at our Community Meetup, the thing all of these have in common is that they render your markup in a Node.js context to produce HTML. The difference is when (build or runtime) and how often.

## Prerendering a Page

Prerendering a page is as easy as it gets. Just add the `prerender` prop to the Route that you want to prerender:

```jsx {3} title="Routes.js"
<Route path="/" page={HomePage} name="home" prerender/>
```

Then run `yarn rw build` and enjoy the performance boost!

<!-- this doesn't render... -->

### Prerendering all pages in a Set

Just add the `prerender` prop to the Set that wraps all Pages you want to prerender:

```jsx {1} title="Routes.js"
<Set prerender>
  <Route path="/" page={HomePage} name="home" />
  <Route path="/about" page={AboutPage} name="hello" />
</Set>
```

### Not found page

You can also prerender your not found page (a.k.a your 404 page). Just add‚Äîyou guessed it‚Äîthe `prerender` prop:

```diff
-      <Route notfound page={NotFoundPage} />
+      <Route notfound page={NotFoundPage} prerender/>
```

This will prerender your NotFoundPage to `404.html` in your dist folder. Note that there's no need to specify a path.

## Private Routes

For Private Routes, Redwood prerenders your Private Routes' `whileLoadingAuth` prop:

```jsx
<Private >
  // Loading is shown while we're checking to see if the user's logged in
  <Route path="/super-secret-admin-dashboard" page={SuperSecretAdminDashboard} name="ssad" whileLoadingAuth={() => <Loading />} prerender/>
</Private>
```

## Dynamic routes

Let's say you have a route like this

```jsx
<Route path="/blog-post/{id}" page={BlogPostPage} name="blogPost" prerender />
```

To be able to prerender this route you need to let Redwood know what `id`s to use. Why? Because when we are prerendering your pages - at build time - we don't know the full URL i.e. `site.com/blog-post/1` vs `site.com/blog-post/3`. It's up to you to decide whether you want to prerender _all_ of the ids, or if there are too many to do that, if you want to only prerender the most popular or most likely ones.

You do this by creating a `BlogPostPage.routeHooks.js` file next to the page file itself (so next to `BlogPostPage.js` in this case). It should export a function called `routeParameters` that returns an array of objects that specify the route parameters that should be used for prerendering.

So for example, for the route `/blogPost/{Id:Int}` - you would return `[ {id: 55}, {id: 77} ]` which would tell Redwood to prerender `/blogPost/55` and `/blogPost/77`

A single Page component can be used for different routes too! Metadata about the current route will be passed as an argument to `routeParameters` so you can return different route parameters depending on what route it is, if you need to. An example will hopefully make all this clearer.

For the example route above, all you need is this:

```js title="BlogPostPage.routeHooks.js"
export function routeParameters() {
  return [{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }, { id: 3 }]
}
```

Or, if you wanted to get fancy

```js title="BlogPostPage.routeHooks.js"
export function routeParameters(route) {

  // If we are reusing the BlogPostPage in multiple routes, e.g. /odd/{id} and
  // /blogPost/{id} we can choose what parameters to pass to each route during
  // prerendering
  // highlight-next-line
  if (route.name === 'odd') {
    return [{ id: 1 }, { id: 3 }, { id: 5 }]
  } else {
    return [{ id: 2 }, { id: 4 }, { id: 6 }]
  }
}
```

With the config above three separate pages will be written: `web/dist/blog-post/1.html`, `web/dist/blog-post/2.html`, `web/dist/blog-post/3.html`. A word of warning - if it's just a few pages like this, it's no problem - but this can easily and quickly explode to thousands of pages, which could slow down your builds and deployments significantly (and make them costly, depending on how you're billed).

In these routeHooks scripts you have full access to your database using prisma and all your services, should you need it. You use `import { db } from '$api/src/lib/db'` to get access to the `db` object.

```js title="BlogPostPage.routeHooks.js"
import { db } from '$api/src/lib/db'

export async function routeParameters() {
  return (await db.post.findMany({ take: 7 })).map((post) => ({ id: post.id }))
}
```

Take note of the special syntax for the import, with a dollar-sign in front of api. This lets our tooling (typescript and babel) know that you want to break out of the web side the page is in to access code on the api side. This only works in the routeHook scripts (and scripts in the root /scripts directory).

## Prerender Utils

Sometimes you need more fine-grained control over whether something gets prerendered. This may be because the component or library you're using needs access to browser APIs like `window` or `localStorage`. Redwood has three utils to help you handle these situations:

- `<BrowserOnly>`
- `useIsBrowser`
- `isBrowser`

> **Heads-up!**
>
> If you're prerendering a page that uses a third-party library, make sure it's "universal". If it's not, try calling the library after doing a browser check using one of the utils above.
>
> Look for these key words when choosing a library: _universal module, SSR compatible, server compatible_&mdash;all these indicate that the library also works in Node.js.

### `<BrowserOnly/>` component

This higher-order component is great for JSX:

```jsx
import { BrowserOnly } from '@redwoodjs/prerender/browserUtils'

const MyFancyComponent = () => {
  <h2>üëãüèæ I render on both the server and the browser</h2>
  <BrowserOnly>
    <h2>üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I only render on the browser</h2>
  </BrowserOnly>
}
```

### `useIsBrowser` hook

If you prefer hooks, you can use the `useIsBrowser` hook:

```jsx
import { useIsBrowser } from '@redwoodjs/prerender/browserUtils'

const MySpecialComponent = () => {
  const browser = useIsBrowser()

  return (
    <div className="my-4 p-5 rounded-lg border-gray-200 border">
      <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Render info:</h1>

      {browser ? <h2 className="text-green-500">Browser</h2> : <h2 className="text-red-500">Prerendered</h2>}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### `isBrowser` boolean

If you need to guard against prerendering outside React, you can use the `isBrowser` boolean. This is especially handy when running initializing code that only works in the browser:

```jsx
import { isBrowser } from '@redwoodjs/prerender/browserUtils'

if (isBrowser) {
  netlifyIdentity.init()
}
```

### Optimization Tip

If you dynamically load third-party libraries that aren't part of your JS bundle, using these prerendering utils can help you avoid loading them at build time:

```jsx
import { useIsBrowser } from '@redwoodjs/prerender/browserUtils'

const ComponentUsingAnExternalLibrary = () => {
  const browser = useIsBrowser()

  // if `browser` evaluates to false, this won't be included
  if (browser) {
    loadMyLargeExternalLibrary()
  }

  return (
    // ...
  )
```

### Debugging

If you just want to debug your app, or check for possible prerendering errors, after you've built it, you can run this command:

```bash
yarn rw prerender --dry-run
```

Since we just shipped this in v0.26, we're actively looking for feedback! Do let us know if: everything built ok? you encountered specific libraries that you were using that didn‚Äôt work?

## Images and Assets

<!-- should name it... -->

Images and assets continue to work the way they used to. For more, see [this doc](assets-and-files.md).

Note that there's a subtlety in how SVGs are handled. Importing an SVG and using it in a component works great:

```jsx {1}
import logo from './my-logo.svg'

function Header() {
  return <logo />
}
```

But re-exporting the SVG as a component requires a small change:

```jsx
// ‚ùå due to how Redwood handles SVGs, this syntax isn't supported.
import Logo from './Logo.svg'
export default Logo
```

```jsx
// ‚úÖ use this instead.
import Logo from './Logo.svg'

const LogoComponent = () => <Logo />

export default LogoComponent
```

## Configuring redirects

Depending on what pages you're prerendering, you may want to change your redirect settings. Using Netlify as an example:

<details>
<summary>If you prerender your `notFoundPage`
</summary>

You can remove the default redirect to index in your `netlify.toml`. This means the browser will accurately receive 404 statuses when navigating to a route that doesn't exist:

```diff
[[redirects]]
- from = "/*"
- to = "/index.html"
- status = 200
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>If you don't prerender your 404s, but prerender all your other pages</summary>
You can add a 404 redirect if you want:

```diff
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
- status = 200
+ status = 404
```

</details>

## Flash after page load

> We're actively working preventing these flashes with upcoming changes to the Router.

You might notice a flash after page load. A quick workaround for this is to make sure whatever page you're seeing the flash on isn't code split. You can do this by explicitly importing the page in `Routes.js`:

```jsx
import { Router, Route } from '@redwoodjs/router'
import HomePage from 'src/pages/HomePage'

const Routes = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Route path="/" page={HomePage} name="hello" prerender />
      <Route path="/about" page={AboutPage} name="hello" />
      <Route notfound page={NotFoundPage} />
    </Router>
  )
}

export default Routes
```
