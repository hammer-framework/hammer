- feat(router): Better autocomplete for `<Set>`s (#11769) by @Tobbe

There's a limit to 10 wrapper components. After that additional props will not be included. To work around this you can either make sure to put wrapper components that doesn't require any props last, or just split your wrappers between multiple `<Set>`s
