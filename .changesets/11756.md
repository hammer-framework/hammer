- [Router][TS] Auto-complete route names for unauthenticated prop (#11756) by @Philzen

- auto-suggests available route names
- will highlight invalid values

This depends on type generation, so either you'll have to run `yarn rw g types` manually, or you'll have to have the dev server running (which regenerates types when required).

This PR is a little breaking, b/c the `<Set>`s generic typing has changed and also the `WrapperType<P>` type has been removed.
