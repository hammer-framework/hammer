- chore(uploads): Reorganise, change uploads package to storage (#11411) by @dac09

This PR does the following:

- renames `@redwoodjs/uploads` -> `@redwoodjs/storage`
- Renames `processors` -> `savers`

They now look like this:

```ts
// reads much nicer âœ…
const processedInput = await saveFiles.forProfile(input)

// avatar is a File becomes a string
// processedInput.avatar =
// '/basePath/uploads/profile-avatar-01J6ACDPWAER8B1SAXPKQK5YA1.png'

const profile = await db.profile.update({
  data: processedInput,
  where: { id },
})
```

even though when you export it, it looks weird

```ts
// api/src/lib/uploads.ts
const { saveFiles, storagePrismaExtension } = setupStorage({
  //...
})

export { saveFiles, storagePrismaExtension }
```

The naming convention is:
`for<Model>` - takes inputs in the shape of a Prisma data for that model but with Files instead of strings. The files get saved to storage, and a key/path is replaced in the value.

`inList` - does the same, but only takes an array of File, and returns an array of stored paths/keys
