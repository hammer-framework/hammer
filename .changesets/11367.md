- fix(template): api type declaration merging for scripts (#11367) by @Tobbe

Make imports in scripts (files in `scripts/`) find our mirror types used for declaration merging also for `api/src/` imports (not just web imports)

Users upgrading are adviced to manually upgrade their tsconfig files to match
what is now in the template.
