- feat(upgrade): Use GitHub token if available when downloading patches (#10515) by @Tobbe

If a GitHub token is available in the environment we use that when fetching the git tree from GitHub. That way we're less likely to be rate limited

We support `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `REDWOOD_GITHUB_TOKEN` as the env var names
