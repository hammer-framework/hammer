- fix(cli): Directive generator command was not creating files (#10698) by @dthyresson

Fixes: https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/issues/10694

The PR fixes a regression in the directive generator where files were not created.

At some point the method to construct files became async. Thus while the command attempted to construct the directive files and write them to the directive directory, it never did.

With this fix, file are written:

```bash
✔ Generating directive file ...
  ✔ Successfully wrote file
    `./api/src/directives/requireEmailValidation/requireEmailValidation.test.ts`
  ✔ Successfully wrote file
    `./api/src/directives/requireEmailValidation/requireEmailValidation.ts`
✔ Generating TypeScript definitions and GraphQL schemas ...
✔ Next steps...
```
