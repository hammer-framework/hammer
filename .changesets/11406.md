- feat(rsc): Initial support for RSA rerender (#11406) by @Tobbe

This PR makes it so that the entire page is re-rendered when a React Server Action returns.
Previously when calling an RSA you'd only get the result of the action back.
Now, when calling an RSA you'll still get the result back, and in addition to that the page will update.
What this means is that if you for example update a counter on the server that a server component is displaying that counter will now immediately update.
Also, if some data has been updated by something external to the app the new data will be displayed (like if someone used an external CMS to update some .md file you're rendering)
