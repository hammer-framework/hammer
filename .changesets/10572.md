- feat: Reworks RSC server entries and route manifest building to derive from routes and include if route is Private (#10572) by @dthyresson

This PR is in furtherance of authentication support in RSC.

It refactors:

- How server entries are built -- not from "processing the pages dir" (which is a deprecated function) but rather the routes ... and the page info for that route. Note here that a page can be used in multiple routes, so the auth info cannot really be determined here.

- The route manifest building to include an isPrivate attribute. Now if some page, route request is being handler we might be able to check if it "isPrivate" and enforce auth.
