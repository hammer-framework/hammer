- feat(baremetal): Add verbose output to ssh exec (#10525) by @Tobbe

Passing `--verbose` to the baremetal deploy command is supposed to give you more detailed info about what's happening. This is especially useful if something goes wrong and you get an error. Previously however passing `--verbose` didn't actually provide any extra information about why an SSH command might have failed. With this PR you'll now see what path it's trying to execute the command in, and what the exact error message was if it failed.

Standard output (this stays the same before and after)

Doesn't really help much compared to the standard output ðŸ˜…
