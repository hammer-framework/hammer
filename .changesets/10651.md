- patch(crwa): Fix small annoyances (formatting, spell-check) (#10651) by @Tobbe

cSpell was complaining about "prerendering". I added it to the dictionary in
project workspace settings. This gets rid of the blue squiggles for the RW
project, but not for any user project. I could also have changed it to
"pre-rendering", but we call the feature "prerender", so it didn't feel right
to change it to "pre-rendering". So this will have to do for now.

Also formatted the source code to me more narrow.

Honestly this is more of a chore than a fix. But it does affect user projects
(at least new user projects). So I marked it "patch". But no change needed for
existing projects unless they really want (and haven't already done it
themselves).
