- feat(storage): Add support for createMany, updateMany and upsert (#11390) by @dac09

Extends the uploads Prisma client extension with the following:

1. `createMany`: support for bulk creation with automatic cleanup of uploaded files if the operation fails.

2. `updateMany`: bulk update functionality that manages file uploads across multiple records, including removal of old files after successful updates.

3. `upsert`: determining whether it's an insert or update and managing file uploads accordingly - delete files on creation fail, and replace files on update
