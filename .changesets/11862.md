- breaking(deps): cookie v1.0.2 (#11862) by @Tobbe

See https://github.com/jshttp/cookie/releases/tag/v1.0.0 for what's breaking in
this release.

We expose the `SerializeOptions` type (that used to be named
`CookieSerializeOptions`), and it has changed.
It's very unlikely that you're affected by this change. But if you are it'd
probably be becase you're accessing our cookie jar, and used its `set` method
you might be affected by this change.
