- feat(uploads): Increase default fastify body limit to 100MB (#11412) by @dac09

Increases the default limit for receiving requests to 100MB (instead of 15MB). This number is arbitary really, but it is the TOTAL size of the request, not of each file being uploaded. 

The user can override this in their server file. 

```jsx
// api/server.js
  const server = await createServer({
    logger,
    fastifyServerOptions: {
      bodyLimit: 1048576 * 2, // 2 MiB
    },
  })
```
