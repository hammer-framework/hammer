- fix(deps) Temporary fix for broken @swc/types package publishing (#10690) by @Tobbe

Set yarn package resolutions to get a working version of @swc/types as
recommended by the Storybook team (see link below)

Ideally we can get rid of this very soon. Resolutions are a pain to deal with
in user's projects because we have to tell them to manually get rid of them
when they're not needed anymore.

See https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/8988
and https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/27385
