- feat(baremetal): Check available disk space (#11469) by @Tobbe

Adds an early step to the `yarn rw deploy baremetal` command that checks to
make sure there is enough free disk space on the server before continuing.

By default it will make sure there is at least 2048 MB (2 GB) of free disk space
but this can be changed by setting the new `deploy.toml` option
`freeSpaceRequired` to however many MB you want.

You can skip this step by passing `--no-df` to the `deploy baremetal` command or
setting `freeSpaceRequired` to `0`.
