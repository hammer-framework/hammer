- fix(api-server): Use createServer in all cases, to make fastify config consistent (#11176) by @dac09

This PR removes all the cases where we use `createFastifyInstance` for the api server, and replaces it with `createServer`.

This makes sure that the API server config is always consistent - whether you use a server file or not. (createServer was only used when we had a server file before)
