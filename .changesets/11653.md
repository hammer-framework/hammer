- fix(jobs): Fixes creating worker with deleteSuccessfulJobs config setting in JobManager (#11653) by @dthyresson

According to the Job documentation, the JobManager's `deleteSuccessfulJobs ` can be used to decide if one wants successfully completed jobs from being deleted from the `BackgroundJobs` table.

Keeping job run history around is useful for reporting purposes, such s hoe many jobs run over time, how many fails, how many successes, etc.

However, the `deleteSuccessfulJobs` was not being correctly passed to the worker in `createWorker` so the worker always used the default value -- true -- and always deleted the job run record regardless of configuration.

This PR fixes this issue by setting the config value when creating the worker.
