# Create Redwood RSC App

This is the RedwoodJS RSC quick-start installer. It's designed to get you
started as fast as possible with a new RedwoodJS project with RSC support
enabled.

It's *very* opinionated. If you need more control over your project setup,
please use our standard RedwoodJS installer.

## Usage

```shell
npx -y create-redwood-rsc-app <desired-installation-directory>
```
