# README

Welcome to [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com)!

> **Prerequisites**
>
> - Redwood requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>=14.19.x <=16.x) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (>=1.15)
> - Are you on Windows? For best results, follow our [Windows development setup](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/how-to/windows-development-setup) guide

Start by install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Then change into that directory and start the development server:

```
cd my-redwood-project
yarn redwood dev
```

Your browser should automatically open to http://localhost:8910 where you'll see the Welcome Page, which links out to a ton of great resources.

Redwood wouldn't be a full-stack framework without a database. It all starts with the schema. Open the [`schema.prisma`](api/db/schema.prisma) file in `api/db` and replace the `UserExample` model with the following `Post` model:

```
model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  body      String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}
```

Redwood uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), a next-gen Node.js and TypeScript ORM, to talk to the database. Prisma's schema offers a declarative way of defining your app's data models. And Prisma [Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/migrate) uses that schema to make database migrations hassle-free:

```
yarn rw prisma migrate dev

# ...

? Enter a name for the new migration: â€º create posts
```

> `rw` is short for `redwood`

You'll be prompted for the name of your migration. `create posts` will do.

Now let's generate everything we need to perform all the CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) actions on our `Post` model:

```
yarn redwood g scaffold post
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8910/posts/new, fill in the title and body, and click "Save":

Did we just create a post in the database? Yup! With `yarn rw g scaffold <model>`, Redwood created all the pages, components, and services necessary to perform all CRUD actions on our posts table.
