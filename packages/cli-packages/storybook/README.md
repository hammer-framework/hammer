# CLI Packages - Storybook

**WIP**: This package is the first example of extracting a command from `@redwoodjs/cli` into it's own CLI plugin package.

<!-- Until we get rid of `@redwoodjs/telemetry` or solve its or one of its dependencies circular dependency issue, we can't use packagephobia to calcuate the size. It times out. -->
